### How to organise my solutions and project files?

1. Create `tiy-front-end-course` GitHub repository with `README.md` file in it.
2. Put your name in `README.md` file.
3. Create a week directory for each week, e.g.: for the first week, create: `tiy-front-end-course/week-01` directory, for the second: `tiy-front-end-course/week-02`, etc.
4. Create a day directory for each day, e.g.: for the first day of the first week, create: `tiy-front-end-course/week-01/day-01`, for the second day of the first week, create: `tiy-front-end-course/week-01/day-02`, etc.
5. Inside of `tiy-front-end-course/week-01/day-01` create `solutions.md` markdown file. If individual solutions require individual source files, then create a directory per solution, e.g.: `tiy-front-end-course/week-01/day-01/solution-01` - all source files go into that folder.
