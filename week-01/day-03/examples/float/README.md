# Example of floats

Take a look at `index.html` file.

Using `float: left` we float image to the left and let paragraph text to wrap around it.

## Why inline image element has top and bottom margins, unlike other inline elements?

Because image is one of the [replaced elements](http://reference.sitepoint.com/css/replacedelements).
