# Problems

## 1

Create a web page (`week-02/day-01/solution-01/index.html` file) that renders a link to your published portfolio page on GitHub.com.

The link should be:
+ `green` when you haven't visited it yet.
+ `red` when you have already visited it.
+ `blue` when you mouse over it.
+ `purple` when you click on it.
+ Change `font-weight` to `bold` when you focus on it.

## 2

Refactor your [portfolio](https://github.com/fedosejev/front-end-course/blob/master/week-01/project.md#project) page from CSS to Sass.

Compile and publish updated version on GitHub Pages.
